## p5.crypto.gnupg - Using GnuPG for your PGP keys

This project serves one simple purpose, which is to create an OpenPGPContext based upon GnuPG
to allow you to securely store your PGP keys in GnuPG. It contains one simple Active Event named
**[.p5.crypto.pgp-keys.context.create]** which is invoked by the core every time it needs to
access a PGP key. This allows you to exchange the project, implement this event in another
plugin assembly, and choose another place to store your PGP keys. At which point you can for
instance choose to store your PGP keys in your database, or some other place that scales better
for thousands of PGP keys - If this is relevant for you.
