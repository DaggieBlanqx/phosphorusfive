## License

Phosphorus Five and all related modules are distributed under the terms of the GPL version 3, as published
by the Free Software Foundation. However, to make a long story short, this implies that you are legally
obliged to release your own work, created on top of Phosphorus Five, as Free Software. If you don't want
to release your own work as Free Software and Open Source, there exists proprietary licensing options,
allowing you to create closed source modules and apps. This is often referred to as _"Dual Licensing options"_.
However, due to the technical implementation details of Phosphorus Five, this creates a couple of legal
_"licensing anomalies"_, which you might be interested in understanding. Some of which are to your advantage,
and others probably not so much - Depending upon which side of the fence you are in regards to _"Free Software"_.

### With Managed Ajax the GPL becomes Affero GPL

Since Phosphorus Five, and more explicitly the _"Managed Ajax"_ parts, distributes JavaScript to the client,
and this JavaScript is an integral part of the core framework itself - This implies that all who are visiting
a website and/or a webapp that you have created with Managed Ajax are in fact _"executing GPL code"_. Since
your own code is built around Managed Ajax, this results in that you are legally obliged to providing the
source code for your own derived works, to everyone who asks you for a copy, _including your server side Hyperlambda
and C# code_ - Unless you have a proprietary license. So for all practical concerns, Phosphorus Five's choice
of GPL, effectively results in becoming an _"Affero GPL license"_.

**Notice**, this has been verified by licensing experts working for the Free Software Foundation!

### With Active Events the GPL becomes LGPL

Another peculiarity, is that since the Active Events design pattern, creates an extremely loosely coupled
binding, between your code, and the Active Events your code is invoking - This results in that parts
of the GPL license is effectively _"invalidated"_, since your derived work, can easily function without
_"linking"_ to GPL code. This results in that you can consume a GPL module/assembly more or less as if it
was an LGPL library. Implying you only have to distribute your modifications to the module itself, if any -
And not necessarily your entire solution's code. This is because of that the loosely binding between Active
Event assemblies and modules, does not create a _"derived work"_, or in any ways _"links"_ between your code
and the module or assembly which is GPL licensed.

So basically, you can consume GPL modules and assemblies as if they were LGPL libraries - Assuming you own
a proprietary license of the Phosphorus Five core itself.

### Phosphorus Five is free and gratis for developers

The proprietary license for Phosphorus Five is sold on a _"per server basis"_. This implies that if
you are a software developer, creating software for others - You don't necessarily need to purchase a license,
and only the customer, who wants to actually host your work needs to obtain a license. If you're a developer
working as a consultant, creating software for customers of you - You can use the Open Source version,
as long as you make sure your customer obtains a _"commercial license"_ to run your work, when he
deploys his solution on his server.

**Notice**, you will need one license for every server you are running Phosphorus Five.

A proprietary license allows for using every major version of the system within the period you obtained
your license. If you for instance obtains a license for the 8.0 version, you can use the same license
for the 8.1, 8.2, 8.x etc version. You only have to obtain a new license during _"major version changes"_,
such as for the above example when I release the 9.0 version.

### Quid pro quo and dual licensing options

Phosphorus Five is distributed under the idea of _"Quid Pro Quo"_, which translates into
_"Something for Something"_. The idea is that either you create Free and Open Source Software yourself, or
you pay me money to help sustain further development and maintenance of the framework.
This implies that unless you want to create Free Software, you _have to obtain a proprietary license_.
Phosphorus Five will ask you if you want to purchase such a
_"commercial license"_ every now and then, in addition to informing your visitors/users about their legal rights. If
you purchase a commercial license, Phosphorus Five will automatically remove any links on your modules,
and stop asking you about purchasing a license.

If you are uncertain about your legal status in regards to the license terms, the fix is
to simply purchase a commercial license. This will also give you _"extended support"_, in addition
to access to a backup module that allows you to easily create backups of your system. It is also the
ethical and morally right thing to do. If you purchase a proprietary license, you will also gain access
to lots of additional material, which I only allow access to for commercial customers of mine.

### How can you sell Free Software?

Why does money hold value?
Money is basically just coloured paper, right? The reasons why money holds value, is because you
can do things with it, that you cannot do with coloured paper. The same is true for a proprietary
license of Phosphorus Five. I have spent more than a decade researching the ideas that are implemented
in Phosphorus Five. This implies tens of thousands of hours, making _your_ job easier. Is your work
worth money? If your answer is no to the previous question, please let me hire you, such that you can
work for me for free! ;)

In addition to that you get the right to create closed source software with a proprietary license, you
also get lots of other things - Such as professional support, access to private support, additional
modules which I only distribute to developers with a proprietary license, etc, etc, etc. I have spent
more than a decade researching the ideas that are implemented in Phosphorus Five, and I happen to
believe that my research has value, not only for me, but also for you. If you agree with me in these
matters, you are welcome to become a customer of mine, and purchase a proprietary license of my work.

> Free as in Freedom, _not_ as in Free Beer!
