In addition, I would like to say a special thank you to the following people and organisations.

* Jeffrey Steadfast for giving me excellent support and help when ever I got stuck in MimeKit or MailKit. This man's brilliance, and willingness to serve, cannot be emphasized enough!
* Gary Gray for providing extensive feedback, and helping finding bugs in the system. I am positively certain about that this man holds some special sort of superpowers when it comes to being able to find bugs, I couldn't even imagine could possibly exist myself!
* Svein Daniel Solvenus for providing extensive feedback in the early stages of the project
* Michael Desmond and James McCaffrey for allowing me to write 3 articles at MSDN Magazine
* The Mono project for making my work possible
* All my friends for being amazing and beautiful
* My three diamonds, you know who you are
* And last but not least, my beautiful and amazing partner, Lisbeth Aardal, for always being supportive and loving me, despite my _"quirks"_
